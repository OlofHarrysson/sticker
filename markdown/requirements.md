# Before you install Sticker

Note that the project is under development and can sometimes function suboptimally.

Make sure that you
- Have a Mac computer with a somewhat recent operative system. It's being developed on Mac OS Catalina (10.15.2) but older versions are probably fine.
- Have Final Cut Pro installed on your Mac. It's tested on Final Cut Pro version 10.4.7.
- Free disk space (~10 GB or more).
- Have Docker installed. You can install Docker Desktop for Mac through their website.
