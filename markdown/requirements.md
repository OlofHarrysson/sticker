# Before you install Sticker

**Make sure that you**
- Have a Mac computer with a somewhat recent operative system. It's being developed on Mac OS Catalina (10.15.2) but older versions are probably fine.
- Have Final Cut Pro installed on your Mac. It's tested on Final Cut Pro version 10.4.7.
- ~1 GB free disk space (10+ GB is recommended).
